# GoLedger Challenge - Besu Edition

On this challenge, you will interact with a Besu node. The goal is to create a simple application that will interact with a Besu node to transact in a smart contract, check the value of a smart contract variable and sync that value to an external database.

To accomplish that, we recommend you use a UNIX-like machine (Linux/macOS). Besides that, we will need to install cURL and Docker.
