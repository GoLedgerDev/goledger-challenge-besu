# GoLedger Challenge - Besu Edition

On this challenge, you will interact with a Besu node. The goal is to create a simple application that will interact with a Besu node to transact in a smart contract, check the value of a smart contract variable and sync that value to an external database.

To accomplish that, we recommend you use a UNIX-like machine (Linux/macOS). Besides that, we will need to install NPM/NPX, Hardhat and Docker.

## Hardhat installation

Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. It helps developers manage and automate the recurring tasks that are inherent to the process of building smart contracts and dApps.

To install Hardhat, you need to have Node.js installed. If you don't have it, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

After installing Node.js, you can install Hardhat by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
